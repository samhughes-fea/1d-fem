DEPRECATED: Total strain energy per element is computed in the TERTIARY pipeline.

Use ComputeIntegratedElementalResults in compute_tertiary/integrated_elemental_results.py
instead; it consumes SecondaryResultSet and FormulationResultSet (current container layout).
This module expected a legacy element_dictionary and dict-like gaussian_results API and
is not wired to the current pipeline. Do not use for new code.

class ComputeTotalStrainEnergyPerElement:
    """
    DEPRECATED. Use tertiary ComputeIntegratedElementalResults for total strain energy.

    Computes the total strain energy stored in each finite element by integrating
    the strain energy density over the element domain using numerical quadrature.

    The total strain energy for an element is defined as:

        U_e = ∫_Ω ½ εᵀ(x) σ(x) dΩ = ∫_Ω ½ εᵀ(x) D ε(x) dΩ

    where ε(x) is the strain vector, σ(x) the stress vector, and D the material
    constitutive matrix. In practice, this integral is approximated via Gauss
    quadrature:

        U_e ≈ ∑_g w_g ⋅ w(x_g) ⋅ |J(x_g)|

    where w_g are quadrature weights, w(x_g) is the strain energy density at
    Gauss point g, and |J(x_g)| is the Jacobian determinant (volume scaling).

    This scalar quantity characterizes the internal elastic work stored in each
    element and is used for energy tracking, verification, and error estimation.
